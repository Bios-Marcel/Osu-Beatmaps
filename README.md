# Osu-Beatmaps

This is a collection of all beatmaps that I have made.
Everyone is free to contribute to these maps under the terms stated in the [license](LICENSE).

## You are a player

If you want to play any of the given maps, simply download the corresponding `.osz` file.

For example the song `Eminem - Venom` would be located at `https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/Osu-Beatmaps/Eminem-Venom/Eminem-Venom.osz`.

## You are an artist

Contact me immediately in case I have used anything that you made without being allowed to do so.

I try to use only art (music, picures ...) that I am allowed to, but mistakes are made I assume.

## You want to contribute

If you want to fix timings, improve the map layout or whatever, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project
2. Clone the forked repository
    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:YourName/RepositoryName
    ```
3. Create a new branch
    ```shell
    git checkout -b name-that-states-what-you-do
    ```
4. Make your changes
5. Create a pull request on the `master` branch.

### File layout

The song folders always contain a sub-directory called `source` which contains all single files.
Next to the `source` folder is a `.osz` file containing the compiled map.
